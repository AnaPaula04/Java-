                <p>Baseball is a game played with a bat and a ball between two teams. Each team has nine players. Teams take turns to bat (hit the ball) and field (catch and throw the ball). The team batting tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running around four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player reaches home plate.</p>
                <p>Players take turns hitting the ball thrown by the pitcher of the other team. The fielding team tries to get players out in several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can try to advance to the next bases during their teammates' turns to hit. The teams switch between batting and fielding after the fielding team gets three players out. One turn batting for each team is called an inning. A game has nine innings, and the team with the most runs at the end wins. If the score is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played. Baseball games do not have a time limit.</p>
                <p>Baseball started from older bat-and-ball games played in England in the mid-1700s. Immigrants brought these games to North America, where modern baseball developed. By the late 1800s, baseball was known as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, especially in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In the United States and Canada, Major League Baseball (MLB) has teams divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL). The World Series decides the champion. The World Baseball Classic is the major international competition for baseball.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>The roots of baseball go back to old bat-and-ball games. A French manuscript from 1344 shows a game with a ball and a stick. Other old French games were similar to baseball. People used to think baseball came from a British game called rounders, but recent evidence suggests baseball originated in England and evolved from games like stoolball and "tut-ball".</p>
                <p>The earliest known reference to baseball is in a British book from 1744. It described a game called "base-ball" with a field setup similar to modern baseball. The first recorded baseball game was in 1749 in Surrey, England, with the Prince of Wales playing. In 1755, an English lawyer mentioned a baseball game in Guildford, Surrey. Immigrants brought baseball to Canada, and the first American reference to baseball is from 1791 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>By the early 1830s, different versions of bat-and-ball games were played in North America. These games were called "town ball" or "round-ball". In 1838, a game in Beachville, Ontario, had similarities to modern baseball. The story that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839 has been proven false.</p>
                <p>In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, created a set of rules for baseball. These rules banned hitting a runner with the ball to get an out. They also used a smaller, harder ball. The first recorded baseball game under these rules was played on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>

                <h2>History of Baseball in the United States</h2>
                <h3>The Game Turns Professional</h3>
                <p>In the mid-1850s, baseball became very popular in New York. By 1856, local newspapers called baseball the "national pastime." In 1857, sixteen area clubs formed the first governing body for baseball. In 1858, the first games that charged admission were played in Queens, New York. These games featured all-star players from different teams.</p>
                <p>In 1863, the organization banned outs made by catching a fair ball on the first bounce. In 1867, it barred African Americans from participating. In 1869, the first fully professional baseball club, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was formed and played against semi-pro and amateur teams.</p>
                <p>The first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, lasted from 1871 to 1875. The National League (NL) was founded in 1876 and is the oldest surviving major league. Other major leagues formed and failed. In 1884, African American Moses Fleetwood Walker played in the major leagues, but a ban on black players lasted until 1947. The American League (AL) started in 1901, and the two leagues signed an agreement in 1903. The National Commission managed relations between the leagues until 1920 when the Commissioner of Baseball took over.</p>
                <p>The American and National Leagues divided into divisions in 1969 and added more teams. In 1994, the leagues were split into three divisions each, with playoffs added for division winners and a wild card team. In 1997, interleague play was introduced, allowing teams from the AL and NL to play each other during the regular season.</p>
                <p>The World Baseball Classic (WBC) is an international tournament for national teams featuring professional players. It was first held in 2006 and is organized by Major League Baseball and other professional leagues around the world. It is the main international competition for baseball.</p>
